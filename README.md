# Heart_Disease_Prediction

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn) is a statistical model that is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of input variables. It can be used to predict the presence of heart disease by analyzing the relationship between the input variables and the target variable.
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn) is a probabilistic algorithm that is based on Bayes' theorem. It is used to predict the probability of an event based on the probability of other events that are related to it. In this project, it can be used to predict the probability of heart disease based on the probability of other related factors.
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn) is an algorithm that is used to classify data into different categories. It can be used to predict the presence of heart disease by classifying the input data into two categories: heart disease present or heart disease not present.
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn) is an algorithm that is based on the concept of similarity. It can be used to predict the presence of heart disease by analyzing the similarity between the input data and the data of patients who have been diagnosed with heart disease.
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn) is an algorithm that is used to make predictions based on a set of input variables. It can be used to predict the presence of heart disease by analyzing the relationship between the input variables and the target variable.
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn) is an algorithm that is based on the concept of decision trees. It can be used to predict the presence of heart disease by analyzing the relationship between the input variables and the target variable.
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn) is an algorithm that is used to improve the performance of decision trees. It can be used to predict the presence of heart disease by analyzing the relationship between the input variables and the target variable.
8. Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras) is a neural network-based algorithm that has been used to predict heart disease in previous studies. It works by creating a network of nodes that are connected to each other and are used to make predictions based on the input data.

The dataset used in this project is from the Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras' and contains 14 attributes and 303 instances. The dataset was pre-processed and cleaned before the machine learning algorithms were applied. The algorithms were trained on 70% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 30%. The accuracy of each algorithm was measured using the confusion matrix. A variety of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (Linear), K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer were used to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. The best algorithm among them was found to be Random Forest with an accuracy of 95%. This project aims to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in predicting heart disease and can be used as a reference for future research in this field.
